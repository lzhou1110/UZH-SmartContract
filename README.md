## Cautious

- Always check the network ID and transaction message before sending a transaction.
If you send a transaction to the mainnet by mistake, you will lose real money :(
- Always check the contract address before interacting with a contract.
- Always check the contract source code before interacting with a contract.
- Consult your tutor (or ChatGPT) if you have any questions.
